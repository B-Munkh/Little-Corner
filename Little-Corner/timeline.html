                        We first matched on a dating app, where I used a pickup that made you immediately fall 
                        for me. Which was "Are you my appendix, because I think I need to take you out".

                    <p>
                        Our very first date, we met in galleria and I showed up dressed lackluster while you were
                        absolutely stunning and gorgeous. It started off shaky and I was really nervious, but I 
                        really wanted it to work and you spotted me googling questions to ask you. After that we went
                        and played some billiards, where we both sucked. The date ended with us holding hands while snow 
                        was gently falling, and I didn't want the night to end.

                        Disaster struck, the thought of buying flowers on valentine's of all days had completely slipped my mind.
                        You were dressed like a princess and I was a complete mess. A horrible movie, no flowers, no valentine's.
                        At this point, I thought I had completely my chance with you, I had to think of a way to make it up to you.

                    <p>
                        What's the point of getting you flowers at this point? Which meant I had to think of something a bit more 
                        creative. I spent the entire day going around the city, collecting materials to make a paper flower bouquet.
                        While it can't beat the real thing, I thought it'd be a good way that I really cared about you.
